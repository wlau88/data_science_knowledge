#OOP

####This is a blackjack game using OOP and nosetest.

Key points of Object Oriented Programming (OOP):

- class is a blueprint, instance is the object realization
- use functions as verbs, nouns as classes
- instance has only fields, not methods
- encapsulation: only methods of class can modify the fields
- private methods only to class, public methods are open 
- is vs. has
	- car is a class. toyota is a car. cat is kind of mammal --> can be inheritance
	- has-a is a composition relationship, steering wheel is a field. 
- interface = same arguments for a method for different classes (e.g. cat, robot, fighter jet has move method)
- abstract class cannot be instantiated (static languages, java) (e.g. mammal)
- when program runs as a script, __name__ has value __main__, if it's imported it doesn't
